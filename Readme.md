# JS Crawler project from Boot.dev course

## Description

This project is a part of a **Boot.dev** course on Back-End Developer Path.
I used this course to get a better understanding of inner workings of JS on Node.

It is a part of my path to building better inner web-tools for me and my colleagues to use.

## Usage

- To run test use: `npm test`
- To run the project use: `npm start <url>`
